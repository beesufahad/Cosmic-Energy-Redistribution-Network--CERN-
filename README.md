# Cosmic Energy Redistribution Network (CERN)

## Overview
The Cosmic Energy Redistribution Network (CERN) is a vast infrastructure framework designed to harvest, distribute, and manage energy resources across stellar, galactic, and universal scales. This system enables the equitable allocation of cosmic energy while maintaining universal thermodynamic balance.
